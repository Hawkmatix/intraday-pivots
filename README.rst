Hawkmatix Intraday Pivots
=========================

Intraday Pivots are among the most powerful type of support and resistance
indicator. They are useful to any style of trader that analyzes a security on
an intraday basis. These pivots are calculated over a period of minute time
values and can be changed to any minute value. The default time value is set to
sixty minutes. For some traders, pivots alone are strong enough to base entries
and exits upon. The standard pivot calculation method has shown the most
correlation with price movement. Other calculation methods are available as
well, which are open included, high weighted, low weighted, and close weighted.
These pivots have five support levels, five resistance levels, and a central
pivot, to provide more zones for extremely volatile periods. The option to
round to the nearest tick is also available.
